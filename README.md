FortAVR
=======

Forth is a virtual machine, a single pass interpreter, and a compiler. It executes a chain of subroutines, called “words” with each word potentially precompiled from other words including itself (recursion). Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and a data stack are used to support the single pass immediate execution program flow. This simple architecture allows it to be implemented on microcontrollers with limited resources.
